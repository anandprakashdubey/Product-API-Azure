********** To Generate ARM *********
Download the creator and build and restore
Run the below command

dotnet run create --configFile  D:\AzureADProject\Product\Product.API\InputFiles\config.v1-rev1.yml

where config.v1-rev1.yml file is config file

and there is master template where it has all the inside template




We have to define backend service as well and give Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key also to make api call.
